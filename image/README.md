# Application Images Folder

This folder contains all the images used in our application. These images may include icons, illustrations, banners, logos, and any other visual resources necessary for the proper functioning of the application.

## Folder Structure

- `icons/` : Contains all the application's icons.
- `banners/` : Contains banners used in various sections of the application.
- `logos/` : Contains logos of the application and partners.
- `illustrations/` : Contains illustrations and other miscellaneous visuals.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Adding a new image:** Place the image in the appropriate sub-folder. If a sub-folder does not exist, you can create one following the existing structure.

2. **File naming:** Use a clear and descriptive file name, preferably in English and without spaces. For example: `icon-home.png`, `banner-login.jpg`, etc.

3. **File formats:** Prefer PNG format for icons and illustrations, and JPEG for photos or heavier images to maintain good display quality while optimizing performance.

4. **Usage rights:** Ensure that all images added comply with copyright and usage licenses.

## Recommendations

- Keep images optimized for the web to reduce application loading times.
- Update this README if you modify the folder structure or usage rules.
